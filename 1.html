<h2>IK의 홍콩여행!</h2>
Hongkong is one of my favorite city. I fell in love with Hongkong. I wanna introduce Hongkong to my visitors.<strong>Welcome to my <u>website</u>!</strong>
First, I had to find a hotel to stay during 5 days,

<p style="margin-top:40px">but It is the end of year, so There was no room
which has a good condition.</p> If I wanna stay
a good condition hotel, It must be very expensive.
So I tried to find a Airbnb.
That was my first time finding a room from Airbnb.
I got a good experience of <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.kr/" target="_blank" title="airbnb website">Airbnb</a> this time.
The host was very kind.
